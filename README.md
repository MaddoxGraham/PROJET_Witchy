# Witchy landing page. (visual and explanation ) 

One of the most crucial pages of the Witchy shop is the landing page, as it directly showcases the desired atmosphere and concept of the shop.

The landing page features a dark and cyberpunk aesthetic. The name and motto of the shop are prominently displayed, and the navigation appears intuitive.
It also is the place where the user will find is account once connected or his online cart (here the alien face is for the account and the cauldron for the cart). If the user chooses to directly browse the categories, the page layout is as follows:

This layout provides a visually appealing and user-friendly way for customers to explore the different categories of products available on Witchy.
If the user chooses to stay on the landing page, they can enjoy a carousel of products categorized by categories or sales. This carousel presents a visually appealing display of various products to capture the user's attention and entice them to explore further.

As the user scrolls through the Witchy shop, the website will dynamically display a selection of randomly chosen products for the user to discover. Each product is selectable and can be clicked on to view more details or add it to the "Cauldron," which serves as the equivalent of the shopping cart.

In the provided screenshot, you can see that the top menu of the landing page is fixed and will scroll alongside the user, ensuring its accessibility from anywhere on the page. This fixed menu allows users to navigate the website seamlessly without the need to scroll back to the top to access the menu options. It provides a convenient and user-friendly experience, making it easier for users to explore different sections of the website and access various features without any hassle.
